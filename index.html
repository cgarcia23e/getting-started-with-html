    <b> The Basics of the Web and HTML</b>
<br>
The worldwide web is made up of HTML documents that are processed and communicated via computers. The HTML documents are what glue evertything together and form the basis of the web. Hyperlinks link everything; making the web weblike.
<br>
<br>
The way the process starts is, an individual goes to a webpage by sending an <em> HTTP </em> request to a <em> server</em> via a computer. 
The server then searches for the appropriate html document and sends it back to the user's page where the <em> web browser</em>
 interprets the information into a form that can be seen on the user's screen.
 <br>
<br>
<b> HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language)</b>
<br>
As mentioned before, these documents make up the heart of the web. HTML consists of: <br>
-Text context (what you see) <br>
-Markup (what the information will look like) <br>
-References to other documents (i.e. images and videos) <br>
-Links to other pages<br><br>
<b>HTML Markup: </b> are made up of tags using the <em>less than </em> and <em>greater than</em> symbols and contribute to the aesthetics and functionality of content. 
There are multiple uses for markups. For the most part, HTML markups contain an <em> opening tag </em>, the <em> content</em> is then written after the opening tag, and is followed by a <em> closing tag</em>. This whole expression is called an element. 
You can put content in bold, italics; create links for additional content; and divide sentence structures. You can also nest multiple markups with each other. 
<p> That said, because computers do not have the flexibility as humans, the commands and element markups must be precise; otherwise mistakes can produce huge programming issues. Being familiar with <em>whitespace</em> and <em>inline vs. block elements</em> can help demonstrate how the markup language must be literal.</p>
<p><b>Inline vs. Block Elements</b><br> White space consists of the characters that represent horizontal or vertical space in typography. HTML elements are all found in the white space and because the typography is represented in either a horizontal or vertical space, 
HTML elements are either <b>inline</b> (<em> in the same horizontal thred</em>) or <b>block</b> (<em> can shift and stay within it's own vertical block space</em>).
